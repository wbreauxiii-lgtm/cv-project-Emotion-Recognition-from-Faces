Emotion Recognition from Faces

Willie Lee Breaux III 

Tier 2 Model: 
I chose this project because I am interested in robotics and in integrating artificial intelligence into robotics. Building an emotion recognition model allows me to explore the human-machine connection. Having natural interaction and adaptive robots that teach machines to understand human emotion is essential.

Problem Statement:
In real world application machines can recognize objects and faces but fail to understand human emotions. This lack of facial emotional awareness limits how technology interacts with human beings, for example, learning platforms cannot sense confusion, and customer service systems cannot detect frustration.

Solution Overview:
This project uses a YOLO based emotion recognition model trained on a Kaggle facial expression dataset and accelerated with GPU processing to classify emotions. The model can be applied in areas like customer sentiment analysis and human AI interaction, where understanding human emotions helps machines respond naturally and accurately.

Technical Approach:
CV Technique: Object Detection/ Classification
Model: YOLOv11 Small (Ultralytics)
Framework: Kaggle Networks with PyTorch, Ultralytics, OpenCV
The YOLOv11 architecture supports both object detection and image classification. Variant YOLOv11s (The small variant) is faster, lightweight, and efficient, which is ideal for real time emotion recognition tasks. Using Kaggle Notebooks provides a convenient environment that allows direct access to the dataset from its source. As well as seamless GPU acceleration for faster model training and testing.

1.| Not reaching target accuracy                     | Medium                           | Use pretrained YOLO model and Optimize with GPU 
2.| Overfitting on training data                     | Medium                           | Use validation split. Apply early stop or regularization
3.| GPU runtime timeout                              | High                             | Save checkpoints to google drive
4.| Incorrect emotion labeling                       | Medium                           | Use a diverse dataset
5.| Slow training/ inference speed                   | Low                              | Use YOLOv11s
