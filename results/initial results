Initial Results

Date: Thu Nov 6, 2025  
Environment: Google Colab (Tesla T4, CUDA 12.4)  
Dataset: fatihkgg/affectnet-yolo-format (YOLO detection, 8 classes)

Summary
- Pretrained YOLOv11s model (`yolo11s.pt`) successfully loaded.
- Verified GPU availability and CUDA support (`torch.cuda.is_available()` → True).
- Dataset structure confirmed with 17,101 training, 5,406 validation, and 2,755 test images.
- Ran sample inference on default YOLO test images to verify the model loads and runs.
- Model successfully detected objects (bus, person) and produced output images.

Notes
- Training process has started but not yet completed. Timestamp: 6:02pm
- No custom predictions or emotion detections have been generated yet.
- Next step: complete training and generate validation/test results.
